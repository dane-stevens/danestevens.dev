# Hi! I'm Dane

## Christian, Husband, Father and Software Engineer (in that order)

I'm a software engineer from Ontario Canada. I was born in 1989 and grew up at [Teen Ranch](https://teenranch.com), a Christian Summer Camp where I had countless opportunities to work in software engineering and information technology.

I am self-employed and design and build software solutions for [Teen Ranch](https://teenranch.com), [NAPA Auto Parts](https://www.napacanada.com), [TOYO Tires](https://www.toyotires.com), [SKF](https://www.skf.com) and many other automotive companies.
